IDEA MASTERS 


In day-to-day aviation operations, decision-makers often encounter unforeseen circumstances that deviate from the original plan, ranging from unexpected weather conditions to changes in aircraft  versions. Currently these issues are resolved by humans which increases the reliance on human judgment which in turns introduce human errors in decision-making.We are trying to revolutionize this approach with the help of our application with uses machine learning,deep learning algorithms and neural networks.<br>

Every day, pilots face various uncertainties like unpredictable weather and unforeseen circumstances. Generally, decisions on landing feasibility majorly relies on human judgment, which can be subjective and inconsistent. Our solution explores how a machine learning model can help predict safe landings, enhancing both safety and operational efficiency. <br>

We have developed a ML Model which is trained on various datasets like weather information and historical flight delays information.Models will take following parameters as inputs and will predict whether it is safe to land or not .<br>
<p>The foLlowing are the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Wind Speed and Direction</li> 
<li>Visibility</li> 
<li>Precipitation</li> 
<li>Thunderstrom Activity</li>
<li>Icing Conditions</li>  
<li>Barometric Pressure</li>
<li>Weather Phenomena</li>  
</ul>

Our model will help pilot to make real-time decision .In real world, real-time data could be gathered using various sensors on airplane, however for current scenario since we donâ€™t have hardware support therefore, in this presentation we are assuming that pilot has to input parameters manually.
